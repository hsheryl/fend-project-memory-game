## Gameplay

Click on a card and it will turn over.  Then click on another card and it will turn over.  If they match then you have made a match toward winning the game.  If they don't match then remember what the cards were so you can match them when you flip over the matching card.

## Dependencies

This game uses bootstrap, Google API's, and JavaScript.
